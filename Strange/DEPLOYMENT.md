# Deployment Guide for Vercel

## Fixed Issues

1. **Client-side Routing**: Added proper Vercel configuration with `vercel.json` to handle SPA routing
2. **Redirects**: Updated `_redirects` file to ensure all routes redirect to `index.html`
3. **Catch-all Route**: Added a catch-all route in React Router to handle undefined routes
4. **Debugging**: Added console logs to help identify any remaining issues

## Vercel Configuration

The `vercel.json` file includes:
- Rewrites to handle client-side routing
- Proper headers for SPA
- Build configuration for Vite

## Routes

- `/` - Welcome page (redirects to login after 2 seconds)
- `/login` - Login page
- `/register` - Registration page
- `/home` - Home page (requires authentication)
- `/verif` - Email verification page
- `/chat` - Chat page

## Testing

1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Test direct access to `/register` route
3. Test navigation from login page to register page
4. Check browser console for any errors

## Common Issues

- If routes still don't work, check that the `vercel.json` file is in the root directory
- Ensure the `_redirects` file is in the `public` directory
- Clear browser cache if testing locally
